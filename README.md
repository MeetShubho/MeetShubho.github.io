# Portfolio Starter — Subhabrata

This bundle is a **ready-to-deploy** personal site for GitHub Pages. It includes:
- `index.html` — the website
- `style.css` — styles
- `assets/profile-bg.jpg` — put **your photo** here (see below)

---

## 0) Make a GitHub account (2 minutes)
1. Go to **https://github.com** and click **Sign up**.
2. Pick a username. If you want your site at `USERNAME.github.io`, choose a username you like (e.g., `subhabrata` if available).
3. Verify email.

## 1) Create your website repo
### Option A — Personal site (recommended)
1. Click **New repository**.
2. **Repository name**: `YOUR-USERNAME.github.io` (replace with your username exactly).
3. Keep it **Public**. Click **Create repository**.

> GitHub Pages will automatically serve your site from the **main branch** of this special repo. No extra settings needed.

### Option B — Project site (alternative)
- Repo can be any name (e.g., `portfolio`). After upload, go to **Settings → Pages** and select **Branch: main / root**.

## 2) Upload these files
1. Download the zip from ChatGPT.
2. Unzip it on your computer.
3. In your new GitHub repo, click **Add file → Upload files**.
4. Drag and drop **all files** from the unzipped folder into GitHub, then **Commit changes**.

## 3) Add your background photo
1. Rename your chosen photo to **`profile-bg.jpg`**.
2. In GitHub, go into the `assets/` folder → **Add file → Upload files** → upload `profile-bg.jpg` → **Commit**.
3. Refresh your site. Your homepage now shows your photo with a subtle overlay.

## 4) Visit your site
- Personal site: `https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io`
- If it shows a 404 at first, wait ~1 minute and refresh.

## 5) Edit content (no coding tools needed)
- Click a file (like `index.html`) → **Edit** → make changes → **Commit**. Repeat.
- Update your links in the **social icons**:
  - LinkedIn is already set.
  - Replace `https://github.com/your-username` with your actual GitHub link.
  - Email and phone are editable in the same section.

## 6) Why did my preview say “This content is blocked”?
- Opening HTML via `file://` or inside certain “Run Code” previews can block resources/anchors.
- Use GitHub Pages (above) or run a local server:
  - **VS Code**: install *Live Server* → right-click `index.html` → *Open with Live Server*.
  - **Python** (terminal): `python3 -m http.server 8000` → visit `http://localhost:8000`.

## 7) Customize further (optional)
- Sections: fill **Professional Career**, **Education**, **More** in `index.html`.
- Colors: edit `--accent` in `style.css`.
- Add projects, blog, or a contact form later.

Have fun! 🚀
