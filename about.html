      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <h2>Why I am not your vanilla Project / Program / Product Manager</h2>

      <p>
        My journey in technology started as a <strong>developer</strong>, giving me a deep appreciation 
        for how things work under the hood. Over time, I combined this technical foundation with 
        business acumen gained through my <strong>MBA</strong> and experience as a <strong>Business Analyst</strong>. 
        This unique blend allows me to connect technology with strategy and user needs effortlessly.
      </p>

      <p>
        Along my professional journey, I have earned certifications like <strong>PMP, PMI-ACP, PSM I, 
        PSPO I, SAFe Agilist, ICP-ACC, and AWS</strong>. Each of these has not only sharpened my 
        knowledge but also shaped the way I approach leadership, agility, and delivering value.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’ve led initiatives across <strong>Waterfall and Agile frameworks</strong>, and my work has spanned 
        industries from <strong>Telecom and Infotainment to Banking, Finance, RPA, Infrastructure, 
        and Product Development</strong>. Being <strong>domain-agnostic</strong> has made me adaptable, always ready 
        to wear different hats and step into new challenges.
      </p>

      <p>
        Today, I’m actively transitioning into <strong>Product Leadership</strong>. I believe in continuous reinvention, 
        which is why I am pursuing the <strong>Executive Program in Product Management from IIT Guwahati</strong>. 
        This complements my hands-on leadership experience and fuels my vision to build products that matter — 
        ones that inspire confidence and solve real problems.
      </p>

      <p>
        Beyond work, I’m an <strong>AI/ML enthusiast</strong> who loves exploring how technology transforms business 
        and society. And at home, I’m a proud <strong>father</strong>, constantly inspired by the curiosity 
        and wonder of my little one.
